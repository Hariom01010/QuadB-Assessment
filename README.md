## Overview

Welcome to the React JS Internship Assignment! In this project, I have created a 2-screen React JS application that interacts with the TVMaze API. The goal is to build a basic UI that displays show names along with some details on the first screen. Additionally, I have implemented a second screen to show the summary of a selected show and include a button for booking a movie ticket with pre-filled details.

## Project Requirements

- **React JS Application**: The project must be implemented using React JS.
- **API Integration**: Utilize the TVMaze API (https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=all) to fetch and display show data.
- **Two Screens Minimum**: Create at least two screens - one for displaying show names and details, and another for showing the summary and booking a movie ticket.
- **Dynamic UI**: The UI should be dynamic and not hardcoded. It's up to you to decide what show details to display on the first screen.
- **Show Summary Screen**: Implement a screen that displays the summary of a selected show.
- **Booking Feature**: Include a button on the summary screen for booking a movie ticket. The booking form should have the movie name pre-filled along with relevant details.
- **Avoid Page Reloads**: Ensure that page reloads do not happen during the navigation between screens.
- **Local/Session Storage**: Utilize local/session storage to store user details.
- **UI/UX Design**: Create a visually appealing UI with basic HTML, CSS styling (you may use Bootstrap for this), and proper component file structure.
